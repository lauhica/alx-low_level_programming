0x0C. C - More Malloc and Free

Project Description: Assigning memory space using dynamic memory allocation. In dynamic memory allocation functions used reserve a pre-determined amount of space to host the address of the pointer. Functions in dynamic allocation are not fixed and can be changed during run-time to allocate or deallocate memory space.

Task 0: Trust no one
Creating a set of instructions that aims to allocate memory using the malloc() function in dynamic memory allocation.

Task 1: String nconcat
Creating a set of instructions that aims to join the source string s1 to the destination string s2.

Task 2: Calloc
Creating a set of instructions that aims to allocate multiple memory blocks for an array using the malloc() function in dynamic memory allocation.

Task 3: Array range
Creating a set of instructions that aims to create a collection of integers, setting the integers sequentially from minimum values to maximum values.
