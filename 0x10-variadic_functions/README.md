0x010. C - Variadic Functions

This task will focus on variadic functions, in particular the ability for a function to take on several arguments as pre-defined by macros vs_list, vs_start, vs_arg and vs_end.

Task 0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant

Write a function that returns the addition of all its parameters.

	Prototype: int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...)

Task 1. To be is to be the value of a variable

Write a function that prints numbers, follwed by a new line.

	Prototype: void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...)

Task 2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable

Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

	Prototype: void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...)

Task 3. To be is a to be the value of a variable

Write a function that prints anything.

	Prototype: void print_all(const char * const format, ...)
