0x14.C - Bit Manipulation

Task 0. 0

Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

        Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)

Task 1. 1

Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

        Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n)

Task 2. 10

Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

	Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)

Task 3. 11

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

        Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)

Task 4. 100

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

        Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)

Task 5. 101

Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

	 Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)

Task 6. Endianness
